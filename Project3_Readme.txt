Only thing needed is to render the picture once povray is loaded and David_Berlin_Project_3.pov is pulled up.

supporting files are Candle_2.inc and Palm_2.inc retrieved from the f-lohmueller.de website for the palm trees and fire. These need to be in the same directory as David_Berlin_Project_3.pov

If 1920x1080 is too much, just change render settings under

Render>Edit Settings/Render> Section.
